# OpenFace

## Introduction
> [**OpenFace 2.2.0: a facial behavior analysis toolkit**](https://github.com/TadasBaltrusaitis/OpenFace), 
> which is a fantastic model for detection of Face landmarking, AU prediction, etc. Alough it offers multiple functions to be used, we just need to use its [AU](https://github.com/TadasBaltrusaitis/OpenFace/wiki/Action-Units) detection model so far. 
> 
> This document will address the errors I faced during installation, and also guide people how to use it.

> System: Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS

## Install
> It's a terrible experience, I had tried a sea of installation methods but all of them are wrong. 
> Hence I decided to install it by myself, and finally builded up OpenFace system.

> There is a website for teaching people how to install OpenFace on Ubuntu 20.04.  
> [How to install OpenFace?](https://devjunhong.github.io/openface/how_to_install_openface/#second)
> I pretty recommend read this blog if you need to install it, which is really helpful.

> However, it is still not perfect fitting our system, so I manually setup a BASH script for OpenFace installation on our system. 
> 
> `install.sh`

## Execution
Please follow the `/user/home/桌面/CFS_raw/Code/OpenFace.ipynb`

## Appendix
> [Vim](http://linux.vbird.org/linux_basic/0310vi.php)  
> For changing BASH script.
